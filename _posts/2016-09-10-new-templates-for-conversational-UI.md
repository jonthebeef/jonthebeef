Following on from the article I wrote in July about prototyping a Facebook Messenger bot interaction in Keynote, as predicted, things have hottened up in the world of UI kits for Sketch so you have the resources to use the same Keynote technique to prototype on other messaging platforms.

Yes, these are all for Sketch, but with some googling around, you'll find these and probably others as templates for Photoshop. And maybe one day, I'll pull some together in Keynote (but no promises there).

### iOS 10 Messages

With the new version of iOS dropping next week, expect to see more UI kits emerge. This is a good start.

Not really everything you might want or need from a Snapchat UI kit, but there's certainly enough here to get started.

### OAuth Dialogues

OK, not strictly conversational UI, but handy for when you need to include a login dialog for a popular service when developing your own concepts for a messaging app.

### Sketch

The ever popular messaging and email replacement platform recently enabled developers to include buttons to enhance interactions from connected services. This might become an extremely popular thing, especially if you design productivity apps and bots.
