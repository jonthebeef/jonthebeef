# “The Product is the Service is the Marketing” - *Russell Davies*

## Using insights delivered through the [discovery phase](/process/discover.md), I work with teams to create innovative solutions using the defined product strategy. By proxy, I’m familiar with Lean UX design principles, meaning I like to quickly bring ideas to life through design and prototyping, and get them into user hands iteratively to establish further stages. My toolkit? Sketch, Invision and Zeplin.
