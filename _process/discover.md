# Before you design the solution, you have to understand the challenge.

## I use data to construct insights around the problem in hand, then look at competitive sets to determine where a product can establish a foothold. I speak to all types of stakeholder to understand their thinking, and where the product should go.

### Desk Research
I examine the problem using a combination of Google-fu, market reports and data gathering.

### Quantitative Research
I use survey tools or community platforms to gain a sense of the problem through data.

### Qualitative Research
Speak to people either in formal or informal interview and focus group sessions.

### Storytelling
Lean research methodologies help quickly identify journeys and insights which inform product design principles.

#### Results
- Problem qualification
- User archetypes and journeys
- Competitive understanding
- Design principles: Who is this for and why are we doing it?
