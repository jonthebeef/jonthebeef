# Without understanding how a product is measured, design can be like shouting into an empty room.

## I always design to be inline with expected KPIs, and if they donâ€™t exist, I help create them. I believe in continual testing with beta communities, and using qualitative techniques to understand deeper human needs.

### Designing to measure

Relaying functional requirements back to measurable events helps define the way a flow progresses.

### Growth
As a sometime founder, continual growth analysis plays in the same sandpit as overall product roadmaps.

### Analytics
I have a working familiarity with all main flavours of analytic platforms including Google Analytics and Mixpanel.

### Iteration
I love responding to the slightest change in user behaviour with solutions to optimise desired user flows.

#### Results
- Continual optimisation of user flows
- Analytical understanding of why users do things
- Contribution to the overall product roadmap.
